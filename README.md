Hi there!  

scaledic is an R package for extending data frames and tibbles with several scale related attributes.    
It is designed to implement (psychometric) scale information to items of a data frame. 
  These include values, labels, subscales, weights etc.. A couple of functions help to organize, extract, replace and impute missing values, find typos, build scale scores etc.

For now, scaledic is already working and up to the task but still in an experimental stage were I might change the basic syntax.
